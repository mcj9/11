            <b>What do these results mean to me</b>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The tests are first off to be taken with a grain of salt. However if to be taken at face value they point to leadership qualities 
            in the case of the Myer Briggs Personality Test. In the learning style test it suggests I learn best by listening.
            In the Situational Judgement Test it suggests high competence in adjusting to various situations and selecting the correct work flow procedures.

            <b>How might the results influence my behaviour in a team</b>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The results suggest that I tend to gravitate towards a position of leadership in a team and put a lot of effort into communicating with my team, making sure everyone is both happy and on the same page.
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <p>
            <b>How should this be taken into account when forming a team</b>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            When forming a team this would suggest that I should assume a leadership position and be involved in decision making for the teams high level plans. It may be useful to form a team with people who are happy to work alongside or with direction from a leader.
