            As far as I know, I am the only person to have ever gained weight hiking the Himalayas (The local food is addictive).
            I enjoy gym, travelling, reading, music and do free online courses on various technology/finance subjects from time to time.

                <b>My Interest in IT</b> <br><br>

            I am interested in Cyber Security, Programming, Excel and everthing related to technology. My interest in IT started when I  
            got given a 386 computer by my grandfather at age 5. In his retirement he used to write programs to attempt predicting  
            the stock market and horse races. I began pulling computers apart, upgrading or repairing them and learning  
            programming from an early age. 
              <br><br>
            I chose to study a Bachelors of IT at RMIT so I could work in the industry. RMIT has a good reputation in the 
            industry. I plan on applying for Microsoft and all the big tech companies at some stage, even doing an internship 
             at one of them would be great. RMIT has overseas work and study opportunities which I’d love to be a part of.  
              <br><br>
            During the course I hope to gain as many skills as possible and learn how the industry works. I’m also hoping 
            to figure out what area of IT I’d like to pursue.
