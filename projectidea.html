          <b>Secure smart phones for everyone</b>
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          My project idea is a smart-phone with physical switches to turn off the camera, 
          microphone, wi-Fi connection, GPS positioning and any other sensor or components 
          on the device that can compromise security. 
        </p>     
        <br>

        <p>
          The focus of the phone would be security. It would be sold and marketed based on its security features. 
          The importance of having physical switches is that they provide no way for components like the Camera to 
          be accessed without the phone owner’s knowledge if it is physically switched off. Cutting access to the
           camera via software is not a secure method as it can still be controlled remotely, by hackers, government 
           agencies and other unauthorised users. 
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          Security for everybody who uses a smart phone is important for several reasons. Edward Snowden leaked documents 
          in 2013 proving that the NSA was spying on it’s own citizens, collecting information on ordinary American citizens 
          routinely and storing the data. (Ewen MacAskill and Hern, 2018) “Edward Snowden revealed an NSA program called Optic 
          Nerves. The operation was a bulk surveillance program under which they captured webcam images every five minutes from 
          Yahoo users’ video chats and then stored them for future use. It is estimated that between 3% and 11% of the images 
          captured contained “undesirable nudity”.” (Curran, 2020) They also had access to record phone calls, text messages, 
          emails, the device’s camera and any data entered onto a phone.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          In addition to government’s spying on users constantly and without their permission there is also potential for
           intermittent attacks from hackers or other groups. There are thousands of documented cases of either attacks or 
           security flaws in electronic devices. One such example is a security flaw exposed in all mobile devices, but 
           apparently Android and Google were especially vulnerable. The security flaw allowed for remote control of the 
           camera without the users knowledge, even using proximity sensors on the device to detect when the device was 
           close to the owners face. (Valinsky, 2019)
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          Another advantage of physical switches on a device over other security based smart phones that perhaps don’t 
          include cameras, microphones, GPS functionality and other components that pose a security risk is that 
          while the vast majority of phone users don’t like the idea of being spied on around the clock by government 
          agencies or other nefarious groups, they also like having a camera and other modern conveniences available 
          when they want it. There are plenty of devices with limited features on the market, however the features are obviously 
          not there when you want them.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          In addition to this the phone would come pre-loaded with security focused software; VPN, encryption, 
          and software functionality to pre fill forms with fake user data in cases where the user does not want 
          to give out their personal information to third parties. Possible additions include dual storage devices 
          on the phone. One with data needed for functionality of the device such as the Operating System, Apps, 
          contact information etc. The other would have new user data added day to day which could be wiped and/or 
          backed up to an external device periodically if the user desired.
        </p>
        <br><br>

        <p>
          <b>Other inclusions in the product line could include</b> 
          <ul>
            <li>A physical VPN device that users could use to connect securely to the internet</li>
            <li> A physical at home cloud device that users could upload their data to regularly, wiping most data 
              from their phone so that they retain no sensitive data on their phone in the case of theft or hacking</li>
          </ul>

        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          Potential drawbacks of the product may be reduced functionality with some websites and applications that 
          refuse to operate if they cannot access certain data and functionality from users and their devices. The 
          overall form factor of the device would likely be thicker once switches are incorporated and this is something 
          that consumers actively avoid. Thinner device are considered more aesthetically pleasing and desirable by the 
          majority of consumers.
        </p>
        <br><br>

        <p>
          <b>Obstacles to this project</b>
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          The early prototype would use a raspberry Pi with android software and various components; LCD screen, camera,
           wi-fi card, microphone etc. The obstacles there would be mostly routine, fiddling with the software to get
            it to run optimally, studying the wiring diagrams and understanding how to connect and operate all the 
            components. Plans for constructing a fully functional smartphone from a raspberry PI are readily available 
            on the internet. If I were to add extra security apps then I’d either have to program them using something 
            like Android Studio or use open source software. Google Developers training has excellent Android App 
            development training.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          Taking it to a commercial stage would involve using industry standard parts such as the central processor 
          and motherboard of the phone, camera, LCD screen and microphone etc. which can be sourced through markets 
          in China (Shenzhen), and then designing a case to fit the switches (I would likely source a designer through engineering friends 
          or if need be other design companies) also the wiring or possibly some components may 
          need to be altered to incorporate the physical switches. 

          
        </p>
        <br><br>

        <p>
          <b>Other potential issues could be:</b> 
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Design choices trade-offs between functionality and aesthetic design</li>
            <li>Sourcing a reputable supplier in China to manufacture the product </li>
            <li>Getting an acceptable prototype often involves numerous back and forth communication and testing with Chinese suppliers</li>
            <li>The final insurmountable obstacle would be that once all the work is done there is nothing to stop industry 
              heavyweights like Apple, Samsung and other companies from incorporating the switches into their products which could 
            take back any market share the product may gain</li>
          </ul>
        

        </p>
        <br><br>

        <p>
          <b>Personal interest in this project</b>
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          I am passionate about security, spreading awareness of security issues to every person, and also empowering the average 
          person to stand up for their rights to freedom and security against governments and other nefarious agents. Privacy 
          and key areas like Financial security are essential to everyone to sustain a free and open society. Mass surveillance 
          and control by large groups can unbalance power in society and aid the suppression of citizens freedoms. Countries 
          like China control their citizens largely through mass surveillance and control of their finances. 
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          I would like to see privacy and freedom given to every citizen. I would like all citizens to have the right to 
          have some control over their own lives and their finances. In the digital sphere this to me looks like total
           privacy over every individual’s computer and smart phone, including over financial payments. If physical 
           currency (cash) is banned and made illegal it would give total control to banks and governments over our 
           finances, and as this is something banks are pushing for in the immediate future, in addition to secure 
           devices and financial processes I’d like to see the emergence and increased use of finance systems independent 
           of traditional banking and government spheres.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          I would like to work in any area of the cyber security industry perhaps helping the Australian government 
          protect itself from foreign threats. 
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          This project with its wide scope in the security realm would educate me on cyber security, potential 
          risks and also the hardware and software necessary to combat those risks.
